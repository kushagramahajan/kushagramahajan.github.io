<h2>Pose - Aware Fine Grained Recognition using Pose Experts (BTech Thesis) [<a href="http://kushagramahajan.me/fgvc_icip.pdf">paper</a>]</h2>
<h4> Prof. Chetan Arora, IIIT Delhi</h4>
<p>In this work, pose specific Convolutional Neural Networks were trained for non-deformable
pose aware dataset images and then merged. In addition, we have trained an additional
meta-network to identify the pose of the supplied image. The ensemble achieved significantly
better results than deeper networks. Our model outperforms that state of the art results on
FGCV-Aircrafts dataset, Stanford Cars dataset and gives only slightly less than state-of-the-
art for CUB-200-2011 dataset. Contributed additional pose aware footwear dataset. <b>Accepted in IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP 2018).</b></p>

<h2>Exploiting Texture Cues in Clothing Parsing [<a href="http://kushagramahajan.me/texture_icip.pdf">paper</a>]</h2>
<h4> Prof. Chetan Arora, IIIT Delhi</h4>
<p>We propose a two-stream deep neural network architecture for fashion image parsing. While
the first stream uses the regular fully convolutional network segmentation architecture to
give accurate spatial segments, the second stream provides texture features based upon
Gabor filters and helps in determining the clothing type resulting in improved recognition of
the various segments. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard
benchmark datasets: Fashionista and CFPD. <b>Accepted in IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP 2018).</b></p>

<h2>Disentangling Factors of Variation in Speech</h2>
<h4> Prof. Saket Anand, IIIT Delhi</h4>
<p>Worked on building a kaldi based toolkit that produces alignment files and word level
segmentation for the input wave files according to the supplied model. Developed CNN-RNN
architectures for emotion classification on the RECOLA dataset, achieving competitive
performance to the state of the art. Currently working on Factorized Hierarchical VAEs for
disentangling gender and accent information from speech.</p>

<h2>DRAM Simulator for CPU Simulator Tejas [<a href="http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/tejas/">site</a>]</h2>
<h4> Prof. Smruti Sarangi, IIT Delhi</h4> 
<p>A cycle accurate model of DRAM memory controller; it is an accurate and publicly available
DDR2/3 memory system model which can be used in both full system and trace based
simulations. Computationally efficient due to the novel semi event-driven model. Tested
extensively by varying number of rows, channels, row buffer management policies and found
to give great results on memory intensive benchmarks like mcf, zeusmp, gcc etc. not only in
terms of accurate IPC figures but also for design space exploration.</p>
