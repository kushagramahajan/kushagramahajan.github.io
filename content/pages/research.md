<h2>Covid Diagnosis and X-ray Analysis [<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-62469-9_6">paper</a>]</h2>
<h4> Dr. Lovekesh Vig, TCS Research and Innovation Labs</h4>
<p>We used lung isolation, Faster RCNN detector, and a CNN classifier for diagnosis of Covid-positive patients from chest X-rays. The work was <b>pitched, and built into an application</b> for identifying Covid-positive patients from normal patients and those with other common diseases. It was <b>published at the International Workshop on Thoracic Image Analysis, MICCAI 2020.</b> Created a system for isolating the various parts of a chest X-ray such as upper, middle and lower lobes, trachea etc. for detailed analysis to assist radiologists.</p>

<h2>Meta-Learning [<a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2020/papers/w42/Mahajan_Meta-DermDiagnosis_Few-Shot_Skin_Disease_Identification_Using_Meta-Learning_CVPRW_2020_paper.pdf">paper</a>]</h2>
<h4> Dr. Lovekesh Vig, TCS Research and Innovation Labs</h4>
<p>We used meta-learning for classification of skin lesions on the ISIC 2018 dataset (with Group Equivariant CNN), and thoracic diseases from the NIH Chest X-ray dataset, obtaining improvement over fine-tuning and other few-shot approaches. Currently, we are extending meta-learning to segmentation of natural scene images and segmentation of tumors in different body parts using CT Scan data. <b>The work is in collaboration with the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, Delhi and published in CVPR 2020 Workshops (CVPRW) [ISIC Skin Image Analysis Workshop].</b> In addition, built a framework for performing meta-learning for semantic segmentation.</p>

<h2>Medical and Cellular Image Analysis </h2>
<h4> Dr. Lovekesh Vig, TCS Research and Innovation Labs</h4>
<p>We worked on abnormality detection in X-ray images on the Stanford MURA dataset. Approaches used were anomaly detection GAN and autoencoders, visual attention and body parts ensemble model for classification of an image as normal or abnormal. Also, worked on the <b>NeurIPS 2019 competition hosted by RXRX.AI</b> on disentangling biological signals from experimental noise for classifying gene mutations from cell images. We compared the performances of the ensemble and the composite site-channel models, performed appropriate preprocessing, and applied ArcFace Loss to achieve test accuracy of <b>96.06% (top 5 percentile out of 865 teams).</b></p>

<h2>Document Information Extraction [<a href="http://kushagramahajan.me/papers/ICDAR_Workshop.pdf">paper</a>]</h2>
<h4> Dr. Lovekesh Vig, TCS Research and Innovation Labs</h4>
<p>We used unambiguous points in characters as keypoints for homography estimation to accurately align document images with a template document. This novel, fast, and memory efficient approach allows precise retrieval of document fields, followed by text recognition on a large scale. Tested on real world datasets of different kinds of forms. The solution is robust to information extraction from complex handwritten documents. <b>This work was published at IEEE ICDAR Workshop on Camera-Based Document Analysis & Recognition 2019, and a US patent has been filed. The product has been sold to several companies like the Landmark Group, Dubai.</b></p>

<h2>Pose - Aware Fine Grained Recognition using Pose Experts (BTech Thesis) [<a href="http://kushagramahajan.me/papers/fgvc_icip.pdf">paper</a>]</h2>
<h4> Prof. Chetan Arora, IIIT Delhi (now at IIT Delhi)</h4>
<p>In this work, we exploited the pose structure in FGVC problems by training pose specific CNNs and a meta network for aiding pose identification. These were then merged to create an ensemble. Our method achieved an improvement in performance over the state-of-the-art on the benchmark FGVC datasets like Stanford Cars, FGVC-Aircrafts, DeepFashion datasets along with the contributed Footwear dataset. <b>This work was accepted in IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP 2018).</b></p>

<h2>Exploiting Texture Cues in Clothing Parsing [<a href="http://kushagramahajan.me/papers/texture_icip.pdf">paper</a>]</h2>
<h4> Prof. Chetan Arora, IIIT Delhi (now at IIT Delhi)</h4>
<p>We propose a two-stream deep neural network architecture for fashion image parsing. While the first stream uses the regular fully convolutional network segmentation architecture to give accurate spatial segments, the second stream provides texture features based upon Gabor filters and helps in determining the clothing type resulting in improved recognition of the various segments. Our approach improved the state-of-the-art segmentation performance on the benchmark fashion parsing datasets, Fashionista and CFPD. <b>This work was published at IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP 2018).</b></p>

<h2>Unsupervised Disentangling of Factors of Variation in Speech</h2>
<h4> Prof. Saket Anand, IIIT Delhi</h4>
<p>Used cycle-consistency and a discriminator for the disentanglement of speaker style information from speech samples in the Timit dataset without any supervision. We build on top of the Factorized Hierarchical VAE approach proposed by CSAIL, MIT. Worked on building a kaldi based toolkit that produces alignment files and word level segmentation for the input wave files according to the supplied model. Developed CNN-RNN architectures for emotion classification on the RECOLA dataset, <b>achieving competitive performance to the state-of-the-art</b>.</p>

<h2>DRAM Simulator for CPU Simulator Tejas [<a href="http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/tejas/">site</a>]</h2>
<h4> Prof. Smruti Sarangi, IIT Delhi</h4> 
<p>Built a cycle accurate DRAM memory controller model. It leverages a combination of event driven and cycle based simulations, and the performance is at par with the state-of-the-art simulator, DRAMSim2. Computationally efficient due to the novel semi event-driven model. Tested extensively by varying number of rows, channels, row buffer management policies and found to be accurate on memory intensive benchmarks like mcf, zeusmp, gcc etc. not only in terms of IPC figures but also for design space exploration. <b>Currently deployed in IIT Delhi, IIT Madras, IIT Patna, University of Adelaide, and other institutions</b>.</p>
