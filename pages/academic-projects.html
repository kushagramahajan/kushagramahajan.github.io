<h2>Hand Gesture Detection and Recognition</h2>
<h4> Mr. Tigi Thomas, Intel Corporation</h4>
<p>An IP project on sensor based gesture detection and recognition for virtual reality devices and laptops. My task was data preprocessing, followed by building machine learning models for gesture detection and recognition taking into consideration memory constraints and output latency. We tested our system on Google Maps and music system applications by providing gesture controls.</p></p>

<h2>Matrix completion based imputation for single-cell RNA-seq data [<a href="https://github.com/kushagramahajan/GraphRegMC-scRNAseq">code</a>] [<a href="http://kushagramahajan.me/pdfs/scRNAseqImputationReport.pdf">report</a>]</h2>
<h4> Prof. Angshul Majumdar, IIIT Delhi</h4>
<p>We show that the graph regularized matrix completion model outperforms the standard nuclear-norm minimization based matrix completion model on most real world single-cell RNA sequencing datasets using several standard evaluation metrics such as clustering of cell populations, cell type separability, cell visualization etc.</p></p>
    <p><br>
<h2>Dynamic Traffic Light System [<a href="https://github.com/kushagramahajan/DynamicTrafficLight">code</a>] [<a href="http://kushagramahajan.me/pdfs/DynamicLightReport.pdf">report</a>]</h2>
<h4> Prof. Saket Anand, IIIT Delhi</h4>
<p>Comparison among the HOG based, Deformable Part Model and deep learning based Single Shot Detector for detecting car density on the roads through surveillance videos. Involved lane isolation and vehicle speed detection through metric rectification followed by KLT tracking to create a deployable system.</p></p>
<p><br>
<h2>Analysis of Customer Churn Patterns to Improve Customer Retention [<a href="http://kushagramahajan.me/pdfs/CustomerChurnReport.pdf">report</a>]</h2>
<h4> Prof. Sumit Bhatia, IIIT Delhi</h4>
<p>Customer Churn occurs when customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or service. We apply several data mining algorithms to derive insights from the data that might help businesses, particularly telecom companies, to retain their existing customer base.</p></p>
<p><br>
<h2>Stock Price Prediction and Analysis [<a href="https://github.com/kushagramahajan/Stock-Price-Prediction">code</a>]</h2>
<h4> Prof. Saket Anand, IIIT Delhi</h4>
<p>Picked three stocks from the National Stock Exchange from three different sectors: HDFC,
Cipla, TCS and study their trends and interdependence with the NIFTY index. Some of the
features used for analysis: Momentum over past 10 days, moving averages, NIFTY index, 10-
day volatility, average price change with varying windows, turnover etc. Techniques used
were SVR, Lasso, Ridge Regression and Linear Regression with varying kernels.</p></p>
<p><br>
<h2>Marine Objects Detection and Segmentation</h2>
<h4> Prof. AV Subramanyam, IIIT Delhi</h4>
<p>AlexNet pretrained on ImageNet was used for detection of marine objects like ships, liners, boats. We made use of Segnet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Image Segmentation. The problem poses difficulty in tracking these marine objects due to the motion blur of the camera in recording these videos. We used DWT filter to analyze the limitations of our model with regards to the relative sizes of the images and objects of interest</p></p>
<p><br>
<h2>How I Met My TA?</h2>
<h4> Prof. Pushpendra Singh, IIIT Delhi</h4> 
<p>Built an Android application through which students could post queries to the TAs of their
courses, set up a meeting time integrated with Google Calender, chat, broadcast queries. TAs
could respond individually or make an announcement and the instructor received statistics to
monitor the efficiency of the TAs.</p></p>
<p><br>
<h2>EmuARM Emulator [<a href="http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~srsarangi/files/software/emuarm/emuarm-src.zip">code</a>] [<a href="http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~srsarangi/files/software/emuarm/emuarm-manual.pdf">manual</a>] [<a href="http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~srsarangi/files/software/emuarm/emuArm.jar">software</a>]</h2>
<h4> Prof. Smruti Sarangi, IIT Delhi</h4>
<p>An Emulator for compiling, running and debugging assembly programs with both ARM and THUMB architectures; key features include breakpoints, memory and jump mappings, step into and step over functionality, and GUI and command line compile and run options. The emulator is currently deployed in the Computer Architecture Course at IIT Delhi and the University of Adelaide.</p></p>
<p><br>
<h2>Building GNU/Linux shell using C [<a href="https://github.com/kushagramahajan/LinuxShell">code</a>]</h2>
<h4> Prof. Pushpendra Singh, IIIT Delhi</h4> 
<p>The shell was designed to perform all the shell operations including pipelining, redirecting
input/output. System commands like top, kill, cp along with other popular linux
commands are also compatible.</p></p>
