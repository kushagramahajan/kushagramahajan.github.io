Title: About Me

I am a graduate student at the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University pursuing Masters in Computational Data Science (MCDS). Previously, I was working at <a href="https://www.tcs.com/research-and-innovation">TCS Research and Innovation Labs</a> as a Researcher, where I was a part of the Computer Vision and Deep Learning research group, working on the visual analysis of documents, and medical and cellular image analysis. Prior to this, I completed my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Technology">Bachelor of Technology</a> in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://iiitd.ac.in/">Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi (IIIT Delhi), India</a>. My research interests are in Computer Vision, Natural Language Understanding, Deep Learning, and Robotics.
