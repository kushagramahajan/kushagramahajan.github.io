<h2>Pose - Aware Fine Grained Recognition using Pose Experts (BTech Thesis) [<a href="http://kushagramahajan.me/fgvc_icip.pdf">paper</a>]</h2>
<h4> Prof. Chetan Arora, IIIT Delhi</h4>
<p>In this work, pose specific Convolutional Neural Networks were trained for non-deformable pose aware dataset images and then merged. In addition, we have trained an additional meta-network to identify the pose of the supplied image. The ensemble achieved significantly better results than deeper networks. Our method achieved an improvement in performance on the benchmark Stanford Cars, FGVC-Aircrafts, DeepFashion datasets and the contributed Footwear dataset. <b>This work was accepted in IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP 2018).</b></p></p>

<h2>Exploiting Texture Cues in Clothing Parsing [<a href="http://kushagramahajan.me/texture_icip.pdf">paper</a>]</h2>
<h4> Prof. Chetan Arora, IIIT Delhi</h4>
<p>We propose a two-stream deep neural network architecture for fashion image parsing. While the first stream uses the regular fully convolutional network segmentation architecture to give accurate spatial segments, the second stream provides texture features based upon Gabor filters and helps in determining the clothing type resulting in improved recognition of the various segments. Our approach improved the state-of-the-art segmentation performance on the benchmark fashion parsing datasets, Fashionista and CFPD. <b>This work was accepted in IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP 2018).</b></p></p>

<h2>Disentangling Factors of Variation in Speech</h2>
<h4> Prof. Saket Anand, IIIT Delhi</h4>
<p>Worked on building a kaldi based toolkit that produces alignment files and word level segmentation for the input wave files according to the supplied model. Developed CNN-RNN architectures for emotion classification on the RECOLA dataset, achieving competitive performance to the state of the art. Currently working on disentangling factors of variation in speech. Used cycle-consistency and a discriminator to improve the disentanglement of speaker style information from speech samples in the Timit dataset. We build on the Factorized Hierarchical VAE approach proposed by CSAIL, MIT.</p></p>

<h2>DRAM Simulator for CPU Simulator Tejas [<a href="http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/tejas/">site</a>]</h2>
<h4> Prof. Smruti Sarangi, IIT Delhi</h4> 
<p>A cycle accurate model of DRAM memory controller; it is an accurate and publicly available
DDR2/3 memory system model which can be used in both full system and trace based
simulations. Computationally efficient due to the novel semi event-driven model. Tested
extensively by varying number of rows, channels, row buffer management policies and found
to give great results on memory intensive benchmarks like mcf, zeusmp, gcc etc. not only in
terms of accurate IPC figures but also for design space exploration.</p></p>
