<h2>Dynamic Traffic Light System [<a href="https://github.com/kushagramahajan/DynamicTrafficLight">code</a>] [<a href="https://github.com/kushagramahajan/DynamicTrafficLight/blob/master/Project_Report.pdf">report</a>]</h2>
<h4> Prof. Saket Anand, IIIT Delhi</h4>
<p>Comparison among the HOG based, Deformable Part Model and deep learning based Single
Shot Detector for detecting car density on the roads through surveillance videos. Involved lane
isolation and vehicle speed detection through metric rectification followed by KLT tracking to
produce a deployable system.</p>

<h2>Stock Price Prediction and Analysis [<a href="https://github.com/git-rishabh/Stock-Price-Prediction">code</a>] [<a href="https://github.com/git-rishabh/Stock-Price-Prediction/tree/master/Reports">reports</a>]</h2>
<h4> Prof. Saket Anand, IIIT Delhi</h4>
<p>Picked three stocks from the National Stock Exchange from three different sectors: HDFC,
Cipla, TCS and study their trends and interdependence with the NIFTY index. Some of the
features used for analysis: Momentum over past 10 days, moving averages, NIFTY index, 10-
day volatility, average price change with varying windows, turnover etc. Techniques used
were SVR, Lasso, Ridge Regression, Linear Regression with varying kernels.</p>

<h2>Marine Objects Detection and Segmentation</h2>
<h4> Prof. AV Subramanyam, IIIT Delhi</h4>
<p>AlexNet pretrained on ImageNet was used for detection of marine objects like ships, liners, boats. We made use of Segnet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Image Segmentation. The problem poses difficulty in tracking these marine objects due to the motion blur of the camera in recording these videos. We used DWT filter to analyze the limitations of our model with regards to the relative sizes of the images and objects of interest</p>

<h2>How I Met My TA?</h2>
<h4> Prof. Pushpendra Singh, IIIT Delhi</h4> 
<p>Built an Android application through which students could post queries to the TAs of their
courses, set up a meeting time integrated with Google Calender, chat, broadcast queries. TAs
could respond individually or make an announcement and the instructor received statistics to
monitor the efficiency of the TAs.</p>

<h2>EmuARM Emulator [<a href="http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~srsarangi/files/software/emuarm/emuarm-src.zip">code</a>] [<a href="http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~srsarangi/files/software/emuarm/emuarm-manual.pdf">manual</a>] [<a href="http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~srsarangi/files/software/emuarm/emuArm.jar">software</a>]</h2>
<h4> Prof. Smruti Sarangi, IIT Delhi</h4>
<p>An Emulator for compiling, running and debugging assembly programs with both ARM and THUMB architectures; key features include breakpoints, memory and jump mappings, step into and step over functionality, and GUI and command line compile and run options. The emulator is currently deployed in the Computer Architecture Course at IIT Delhi and the University of Adelaide.</p>


<br>
<h2>Building GNU/Linux shell using C</h2>
<h4> Prof. Pushpendra Singh, IIIT Delhi</h4> 
<p>The shell was designed to perform all the shell operations including pipelining, redirecting
input/output. System commands like top, kill, cp along with other popular linux
commands were also compatible.</p>
